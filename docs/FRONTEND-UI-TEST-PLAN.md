   - Equity Return: 8%
   - Equity Volatility: 15%
   - Bond Return: 3%
   - Bond Volatility: 5%
   - Correlation: 0.2
3. Submit simulation
4. **Expected**:

   - Organization management
   - User management (if implemented)
   - All simulation features
   - Subscription management
   - Usage statistics

#### 6.2 USER Role Testing (To be implemented)

#### 8.1 Simulation Limits Testing
1. Create simulations up to the plan limit (10 for FREE)
2. **Expected**: 
   - Should allow up to limit
   - Should prevent creation beyond limit
   - Should show accurate remaining count

#### 8.2 Session Management
