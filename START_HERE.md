---

## ⚡ Quick Verification (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Check compilation
cd apps/client && npm run build
# Expected: ✅ Build succeeds

# 2. Check new API method exists
grep -c "async executeSimulation" apps/client/src/shared/services/api.ts
# Expected: 1 (one match)

# 3. Check Web Worker is removed
grep -c "let worker" apps/client/src/features/simulation/stores/simulation.ts
# Expected: 0 (no matches)

# 4. Check store has no errors
cd apps/client && npx tsc --noEmit src/features/simulation/stores/simulation.ts
# Expected: ✅ No errors

# If all pass ✅, ready to test!
```

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

- [x] Backend endpoint implemented
- [x] Backend engine working
- [x] API service method added
- [x] Store refactored
- [x] Response mapping implemented
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] Run 9 test cases (NEXT)
- [ ] Deploy to production (AFTER TESTING)

---

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Web Worker → Backend API
- **Before:** Browser computes → Web Worker message events
- **After:** Server computes → HTTP response → mapped result

### Response Mapping
- Backend returns different format than local Monte Carlo
- Frontend maps backend response to component-expected format
- All components work without modification

### No Breaking Changes
- Display components unchanged
- API service gains new method
- Store function refactored but signature same

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backend must be running** for frontend simulations to work
2. **JWT token required** for all simulation requests
3. **Database must be accessible** (Prisma schema pushed)
4. **Response format adapted** but all data preserved
5. **Fully reversible** if rollback needed
